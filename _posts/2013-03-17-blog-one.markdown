Would you know it. Starting another blog.

Just wanted to introduce my jsonViewer for knockout. The aim is to make it a little easier to debug your view models. As it can be really difficult to get an idea of what's going on behind the scenes. It shows you the view model as it currently is and the number of times each of the observables (and none) properties have changed. Check it out on [github](https://github.com/mat-mcloughlin/jsonViewer) or the [examples](http://jsfiddle.net/mjmcloug/4F4VX/3/).

Its not finished yet, things to come are: showing the number of subscribers, allowing the view model tree to be expanded/collapsed and pinning the view model to the top of the page.
