At the pub the other day I was speaking to my friend Macs Dickinson and he was explaining that he gave himself 30 targets for the year. It got me thinking, maybe I should do the same. I thought 30 may be too many for me so I've gone with 12 and given myself a year:

# 1. Speak at a conference
I'm actually going to achieve this one in the next couple of days. I'll be speaking at [NDC London](http://ndc-london.com/) about the Nancy framework. This has been an aim of mine for a while now and I'm really looking forward to it.

# 2. Contribute to an OSS Project
And by this I mean regularly. I have already contributed in small part to a couple of projects, but not often. I'll feel like I've achieved this if I manage to contribute on a bi-weekly basis. 

# 3. Create and maintain a framework or library
I'm not sure how to make this work at the moment. All I know is the people I respect most in the development community have managed to successfully create and maintain a framework of some kind. Be it Andreas and Steven with Nancy, Rob C with Massive or Pete with his up and coming [Superscribe](http://superscribe.org/). I'd like to think I have it in me to manage something like this. However I've still not found a need =(

# 4. Maintain a blog for a full year
I started this blog in March 2013 and have been writing 2-4 posts a month. It's not been the first time I've tried to starting writing a blog but it is the first time I've gotten past two articles =). It's been going well so far and I've had a little bit of interest, which is great. Here are my views so far:

# 5. Write an article for a community blog
As well as writing for my own blog I want to contribute to a community blog. Be it an MSDN article or Smashing Magazine

# 6. Learn a new language
And by learn, I don't mean learn how to write hello world. My main language at the moment is C# but I want to learn something new. Candidates are currently nodejs or F#. I'm not sure which I'm going to go for yet.

# 7. Get my fat percentage to 18%
I'm not fat. Although I've been recuperating from a minor operation I had 4 months ago and have not been able to do any exercise. Ideally in the next 12 months I want to get my fat percentage down to something reasonable. I'm currently at 25%. I have a feeling this is going to be the most difficult achievement to unlock.

# 8. Climb a 7b Outside
For those of you who don't know me, I climb a lot. I've always done it for fun but I'm very aware the I wont be able to climb strong for much longer. I'm only 31, but is definitely a young mans game. I have one climb in mind that I want to get and a spot near my home. It's called Blockbuster:

# 9. Walk in to Gaping Gill
6 months ago my friend picked up a caving book for Yorkshire (published in 1976 but we figured caves wont change that often). We went down some minor caves near my home. It scared the hell out of me, but it felt like a massive achievement. Next I want to try something a little more involved like Gaping Gill

# 10. Surf in Hawaii
I went to Hawaii last year to get married. It was an incredible experience and I'm planning to go back in Feb 2014. I did surf whilst I was there so technically I've unlocked this one already. I just want to do it again.

# 11. Go to Le Mans
Not much to say about this one. Its been on my list for a while. Going to get tickets this year and do it. 

# 12. Run a half marathon
I've got a feeling this one is going to be difficult too. I used to run when I was younger but stopped due to an injury. Time to pick up the game again.

I'm going to write about each if and when accomplish them. Wish me luck!
