For those of you who don't know, I did my first talk a couple of nights ago (29/8/2013) at [Leeds Sharp](http://www.leeds-sharp.org/). It was on [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) and I think it went pretty well. However, I've already noticed a lot of ways that I need to improve. 

I organised my talk like this:

1. A quick introduction about me and what I do.
2. An introduction to the Nancy framework. When it was created, why and by whom.
3. I talked about the [Super Duper Happy Path](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Introduction#the-super-duper-happy-path).
4. I demonstrated how to create a NancyModule and explained some of the benefits.
5. I gave examples on how to use route arguments, model bind and validate.
6. I showed how to create and return views.
7. I covered testing and the Nancy testing framework.
8. Finally I implemented Nancy into an existing ASP.NET MVC application.

It took a little over an hour and I realised I need to do these things:

## Relax
I'm not a nervous person by nature, but this was a new experience for me. I've given talks before but never to my peers, so I was a little nervous. I found taking 5 minutes to calm myself down before entering the room really helped.

## Speak Slowly
Because you are going to be nervous you're naturally going to want to talk more, or at least that's what happened to me. I made a conscious effort to slow my speech down. Not the point that I sounded like I was being played at half speed, but just enough so that it gave me time to think about my sentences. 

## Learn the Lingo
I know one of the things I do a lot of at work or during normal conversation is to replace terms with "thingy" or "whats-it". 

> You know that whats-it that pulls out the data. Can you use the thingy pattern on it. Yeah you know what I mean??
	
No, no they don't. I spent time learning the proper terminology for the field and made sure that I used it.

## Avoid Catchphrases
I didn't do very well on this during my talk. I must have said:

> And it works like that "straight out of the box"
	
So many times. I knew I was constantly repeating it but I couldn't think of anything else to say. I think speaking slower helped me to avoid doing this more, but its something I'm going to have to work on.

## If you don't know the answer just admit it
I think this is the biggest fear for anybody giving a talk. It was for me. But then I realised, unless you're Jon Skeet, there are going to be gaps in your knowledge. This is the case for everybody. I decided if I didn't know the answer I would just say. But I would also offer to find out for them, or give them a way to find out themselves.

## Notes
Have notes. You're going to forget what you are wanting to show. I did and I couldn't get access to my notes due to lack of internet connection. It wasn't a disaster, but it could have been.

## Have a Finished Demo
I knew there was the possibility that something could go wrong. Probably because I'd lose the ability to type with all those people watching me. I figured if I had a demo to go back to, it wouldn't be as big an issue.

## Don't use Resharper or Shortcuts
I wanted people to follow along with my talk as the crowd was only small. I realised soon into it that if I start flicking around with Resharper shortcuts nobody would be able to follow. Better still I tried to use the mouse for navigation. I think this made it easier to follow.

## Keep your examples simple
I went to NDC at Oslo this year and watched a talk by [@davidfowl](https://twitter.com/davidfowl) and [@DamianEdwards](https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards). During the course of their talk they coded, from scratch, a basic SignalR example. I was very impressed, you really should watch [it](http://vimeo.com/68383353). There was no way I could do anything so complicated under pressure. So I decided to keep my examples simple then less could go wrong.

## You can never have enough water
My throat has never been so dry. I had one small cup of water. Big mistake. I need to make sure I have at least a bottle but not drink so much I need the toilet :D

So thats pretty much it. These are the things I realised after my first talk. I'm hoping to do more soon and to get out into the wider community as I really enjoyed it.

I've got a feeling I'm going to learn a lot more than the people in my audience do!
