I've just realeased Omnisharp for Brackets v0.0.2. It's still in the very early stages but I've tidied up some bugs and added a couple more features:

### Fix Code Issue

This will attempt to fix the selected code issue. Such as incorrect naming of fields etc:

### Underline Code Issues

Now as well as errors any code issue will be underlined. For example unused variables:
